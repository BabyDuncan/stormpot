/**
 * A general purpose {@link stormpot.LifecycledResizablePool} implementation
 * based on a queueing design.
 * <p>
 * The design is simple and straight forward, and exhibits a reasonable
 * base-line performance in all cases. If, however, the same threads are going
 * to claim and release objects from the pool over and over again — for
 * instance in the case of a typical Java web application — then
 * {@link stormpot.bpool.BlazePool} is likely going to yield better
 * performance.
