/**
 * The expiration is used to determine if a given slot has expired, or

 * <p>
 * Note that Expiration instances must be thread-safe, as they may be
 * accessed concurrently by multiple threads. However, for a given
 * {@link SlotInfo} and {@link Poolable} instance, only a single thread will
 * invoke the expiration at a time. This means that there is no need to
 * synchronise on the SlotInfo or Poolable objects. The easiest way to ensure
 * this, is to make sure that they never mutate any state. If they do, however,
 * then they must do so in a thread-safe manner, unless the mutable state is
 * contained within the SlotInfo or Poolable objects â€“ in this case, the
 * mutable state will be thread-local. Be aware that making the
 * {@link #hasExpired(SlotInfo) hasExpired} method {@code synchronized} will
 * most likely severely reduce the performance and scalability of the pool.
