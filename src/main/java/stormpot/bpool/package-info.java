/**
 * A general purpose {@link stormpot.LifecycledResizablePool} implementation
 * designed to be fast and scalable in the common multi-threaded server-side
 * case.
 * <p>
 * BlazePool optimises for the case where the same threads need to claim and
 * release objects over and over again. On the other hand, if the releasing
 * thread tends to differ from the claiming thread, then the major optimisation
 * in BlazePool is defeated, and performance regresses to a slow-path that is
 * a tad slower than {@link stormpot.qpool.QueuePool}.
