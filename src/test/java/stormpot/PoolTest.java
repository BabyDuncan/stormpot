/**
 * This is the generic test for Pool implementations. The test ensures that
 * an implementation adheres to the general contract of the Pool interface,
 * given certain circumstances and standardised configurations.
 * <p>
 * Pools may have other properties, and may be configurable to deviate from
 * the standardised behaviour. However, such properties must not be
 * observable within the standardised spectrum of configurations.
 * <p>
 * The tests for any special properties that a pool may have, must be put in
 * a pool-specific test case. Do not use assumptions or other tricks to
 * pollute this test case with tests for pool-specific or non-standard
 * behaviours and configurations.
 * <p>
 * The test case uses theories to apply to the set of possible Pool
 * implementations. Each implementation must have a PoolFixture, which is
 * used to construct and initialise the pool, based on a {@link Config}.
 * <p>
 * The only assumptions used in this test, is whether the Pool is a
 * LifecycledPool or not. And most interesting pools are life-cycled.
 * LifecycledPools can be shut down. This is a required ability, in order to
 * test a number of behaviours, but also brings about its own set of new
 * behaviours and flows that needs to be tested for. Those tests are also
 * included in this test case.
 * <p>
 * <strong>Note:</strong> when adding, removing or modifying tests, also
 * remember to update the {@link Pool} javadoc - especially the part about
 * what promises are provided by the Pool interface and its implementations.
